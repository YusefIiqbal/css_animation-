1. Hover - The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).

2. Active - The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button and ends when it is released. The :active pseudo-class is commonly used on <a> and <button> elements, but may be used on other elements, too.
